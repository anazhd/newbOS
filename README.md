## Got Brew?
Familiar with aptitude but then again, on macOS it's kinda 
"unavailable". You can always brew it. 

`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

## Update Nano
Latest and greatest!

```
$ brew install homebrew/dupes/nano
$ echo "include /usr/local/share/nano/*.nanorc" > ~/.nanorc
```
